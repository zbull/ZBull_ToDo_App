Hi Jay,

Here is my To Do App task. I had a lot of fun writing it! Also learnt a lot too. 

I spent more than half of the time on setting up a mod_mono appliance on my virtual machine. 
I continued my studies on AngularJS and started to learn how to use Virtual Studio, 
in which I ultimately wrote the task.
