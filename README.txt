Hi Jay,

Here is my To Do App task. I had a lot of fun writing it! Also learnt a lot too. 

I spent more than half of the time on setting up a mod_mono appliance on my virtual machine. 
I continued my studies on AngularJS and started to learn how to use Virtual Studio, 
in which I ultimately wrote the task.

To view the app just browse to index.html



NOTES

*Datepicker
  I found out that HTML5's datepicker tag is only supported on Chrome. I need to change it to Bootstrap UI 
  to have the accessibility through other browsers as well.
  
*Progress bar/ JQuery UI slider
  I'm currently learning more about ng-storage and trying to find a way to save the progress bar value.
